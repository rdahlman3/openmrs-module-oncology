Purpose
-------

This document captures options gathered during first week of discussions about how to implement ordering of oncology (chemo specifcally) treatment regimens within OpenMRS Mirebalais distro and provide dashboard analytics about their treatment.


Context
-------

This capability is being added as part of a 3-week on-site engagement between PIH and IBM teams. The goal is to provide a completed set of features for use with Mirebalais distro. 

The scope was focused on doctor-centric workflow during initial consultation/diagnosis of a cancer patient which requires doctor order chemotherapy treatment which is likely to be recurring and re-validated during each cycle visit.

This doctor workflow's use cases are not currently part of Mirebalais distro are:
- Order a chemo treatment from a well-known list of oncology regimens (i.e. templates), this includes ability to adjust drug values before submitting final order.
- Modify chemo treatment - after initial ordering - if needed based on doctor's assessment of patient's reaction to treatment regimen.
- Review patient's historical (dashboard) oncology treatment data (i.e. longitudinal view) when needed.


Assumptions
-----------

- OpenMRS 2.1.3 (or higher) platform w/ Mirebalais distro deployment (i.e. concept dictionary, modules, UI, etc).
- Oncology regimens supported in this effort will (at a minimum) cover the scope of Haiti's chemotherapy treatment forms provided:

- Dictionary dataset (i.e. concepts and related metadata) might (and can) be modified using PIH dataset process.
- Data model could be extended or modified, if needed.


Functional Requirements
=======================

The updated system with oncology treatment ordering capability will leverage existing data model objects and api semantics as much as possible. There is already a substantial coverage of required modeling for supporting oncology regimens. Data concepts such as `OrderSet`, `OrderGroup`, and `Order` provide base for most of the above data interactions.


Use Cases
=========

**Doctor (DR)** use cases (primary data model classes involved are `Patient`, `OrderGroup`, `Order`, `OrderSet`, `OrderSetMember`, `OrderType`, `Encounter`):
- DR_UC1: As a doctor, I want to select and edit a chemotherapy regimen from a pre-configured set available during ordering.
- DR_UC2: As a doctor, I want to submit an order for the selected chemotherapy regimen in DR_UC1 use case.
- DR_UC3: As a doctor, I want to modify chemotherapy regimen *initially ordered* for a patient (i.e. before final order confirmation).
- DR_UC4: As a doctor, I want to modify chemotherapy regimen *previously ordered* for a patient (i.e. order is already in data model)

---

**Adminstrative (AD)** use cases (primary data model classes involved are):
- AD_UC1: As a nurse, I want to capture chemotherapy delivery observations for treatment cycle received on a specific visit.
- AD_UC2: As a nurse, I want to ...

---

**Order Templates (OT)** use cases (primary data model classes involved are `OrderSet`, `OrderSetMember`, `OrderType`):
- OT_UC1: As an oncology clinician, I want to author oncology regimen templates for use in EMR solution.
- OT_UC2: As an oncology clinician, I want to update an existing oncology regimen template currently in use in EMR solution.

Technical Flows
===============

- Data Model: 
![](images/muraly-data-model.png)

DR_UC1 - Select chemotherapy regimen from list 
------

- Summary flow:
  1. Query all `OrderSet` templates available, returns array
  2. For each `OrderSet` in array above, query each `OrderSet`, `OrderSetMember`, `Concept`, `OrderType`, `OrderTemplate` detail attributes
  3. Use `OrderSet` indication attribute to group regimen classifications (i.e. "Chemotherapy" vs. "HIV")

- Implementation notes: Data encoded in `OrderSetMember.orderTemplate` is a seralized escaped JSON string that must be decoded in presentation later to understand data. When creating `Order` objects in the next use case, the final JSON string must be serialized similarly containing the updated (if applicable) chemotherapy drugs being ordered by doctor in final initial order.

response: HTTP 200 [body](samples/get-ordersetmember-response.json)  
  
  
DR_UC2 - Submit an order for the selected chemotherapy regimen in DR_UC1 use case
------

- Summary flow:
  1. Get the current `Provider` (based on who is logged in, get from the session)
  2. Get the `EncounterRole` (this will be fixed for all orders, so just need a hard coded query) `https://humci.pih-emr.org/mirebalais/ws/rest/v1/encounterrole?q=Ordering%20Provider`
  3. Get the `Encounter` type (fixed again, need a hard coded query) `https://humci.pih-emr.org/mirebalais/ws/rest/v1/encountertype?q=Test%20Order`
  4. Get the current `Location` (get from the session)
  5. Get the `Patient` ID (hopefully this comes from the page/url that we are given)
  6. Construct the `OrderGroup` and `Order` objects and submit as described below

- Implementation notes: Response from the `POST /mirebalais/ws/rest/v1/encounter` request returns the same document submitted but with more of the fields completed, e.g. the UUID for the Encounter which has just been created. encounter role is a description of the type of person who is involved in the encounter (e.g. nurse) For existing drug orders, it looks like this is retreived with a query to `https://humci.pih-emr.org/mirebalais/ws/rest/v1/encounterrole?q=Ordering%20Provider`. Provider looks like a wrapper around person - not sure how to get this.

Proposal
========
Several objects in the data model are missing fields that are necessary for the chemotherapy regimen ordering workflow. These objects and the missing fields are:
- OrderGroup
    - Cycle number
    - Physician notes
    - Category (Chemotherapy, HIV, etc)
    - Number of cycles in the regimen
    - Length of the cycles in the regimen
    - Previous Order Group
- OrderSet
    - Category (Chemotherapy, HIV, etc)
    - Number of cycles typical in the regimen
    - Length of cycles typical in the regimen
- DrugOrder
    - Dosing reduction
    - Chemo administration group (Premedication, Chemotherapy, Post Medication)
- Maximum lifetime dose
- Drug
    - Units for the maximum daily dose

On OrderGroup, physician notes will exist as an Observation on the Encounter associated with the OrderGroup. Category will exist on the OrderGroup class. We will extend the table via attributes, and create AttributeTypes for the rest of the missing fields.

OrderSet Category will be on the existing table, and the rest of the missing fields will be AttributeTypes, as we will also extend OrderSets via attributes.

Extending via attributes will require changing the base class of OrderGroup and OrderSet from Changeable to Customizable.

One option for handling the missing Order fields would be to put the chemo administration group in the Order.orderReason field, and serialize the dosing reduction in the DrugOrder.dosingReduction field, as that was the intended use of the field according to [this wiki](https://wiki.openmrs.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=34146504). We also are considering adding the extending the DrugOrder class in a new class called ChemoOrder.

<img src="images/ChemoOrderExt.png" width="600" height="292">

For maximum lifetime dose, it is typically associated with the drug concept or ingredient, and not a specific formulation. As such, we will associate the maximum lifetime dose to a drug's Concept via ConceptAttributes.

The maxiumum daily dose for a Drug already exists in the Drug table, but there are no units associated with that field, so we will add a doseLimitUnits field to Drug to capture the units for the Drug's maxiumumDailyDose and minimumDailyDose.
